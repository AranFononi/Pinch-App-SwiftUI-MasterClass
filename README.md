# Pinch & Zoom Viewer 📱🖼️

### Learning SwiftUI Gestures, Animations & Component Design

This project is from Chapter 11 of the SwiftUI Masterclass. The main goal was to build a pinch-to-zoom image viewer using tap, drag, and magnification gestures. I also took it a step further by breaking everything into small, clean components for better code structure.

## 📌 Project Overview  
A minimal SwiftUI image viewer with smooth zoom, drag, and tap-to-reset interactions. UI updates in real-time and stays responsive while scaling or moving the image.  

## 🚀 What I Focused On  
- **Gestures in SwiftUI:** Tap, drag, and magnification  
- **Custom Components:** Split UI into small reusable views  
- **Smooth Animations:** Used `withAnimation` and `symbolEffect`  
- **View Coordination:** Managed state across different parts of the app  

## 🔥 Features  
✅ Pinch to zoom in and out  
✅ Double tap to zoom and reset  
✅ Drag to move image around  
✅ Info panel with scale and position values  
✅ Drawer with thumbnails to switch images  
✅ Clean and modular structure
